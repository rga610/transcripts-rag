DEFINITIONS AND RESPONSIBILITIES

This section provides clear definitions of key terms used within this SOP and outlines the roles and
responsibilities of personnel involved in the data backup and recovery process. Understanding
these definitions and responsibilities ensures all parties are aligned and aware of their duties.

DEFINITIONS

Backup

RESPONSIBILITIES

IT Specialist

The process of creating a copy of data to
protect it against loss or corruption.

Recovery

The process of restoring data from a backup
after data loss or corruption.

Incremental Backup

A backup that captures only the changes made
since the last backup.

Full Backup

A complete copy of all data.

Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)

A documented process or set of procedures to
recover and protect a business IT infrastructure
in the event of a disaster.

Retention Period

The duration for which backup data is kept
before it is deleted or overwritten.

Responsible for performing regular backups,
monitoring backup processes, and initiating
recovery procedures when necessary.

Data Owner

Responsible for ensuring that the data under
their management is classified correctly, backed
up according to the prescribed schedule, and
accessible for recovery operations. They also
coordinate with the IT department to address
any issues or special requirements related to
data backup and recovery.

IT Manager

Ensures compliance with the backup schedule,
reviews backup logs, and oversees recovery
testing.

Chief Information Officer (CIO)

Approves backup and recovery policies, and
ensures adequate resources are allocated for
backup infrastructure and processes.

BACKUP SCHEDULING

For backup scheduling, it is essential to perform a full backup of all critical data every Friday at
10:00 PM. This ensures that a comprehensive copy of all data is created at the end of each week.
Additionally, incremental backups should be performed daily at 10:00 PM. Incremental backups are
efficient because they only capture changes made since the last backup, which helps save storage
space and reduces backup time. By adhering to this schedule, the organization ensures that data is
regularly updated and can be easily restored in the event of data loss. Consistent monitoring of the
backup processes is necessary to confirm their successful completion. Any issues identified during
the backup should be promptly addressed to maintain data integrity and availability. This
structured approach to backup scheduling helps safeguard critical data and supports the overall
data management strategy.

BACKUP STORAGE

Effective backup storage is vital for ensuring the security and availability of critical data. By storing
backups in a secure, offsite location with encryption, organizations can protect against data loss
due to physical damage, theft, or cyber-attacks. Regularly reviewing and updating backup storage
practices helps maintain the integrity and accessibility of backup data. It is essential to follow a
well-defined process for storing, managing, and verifying backups to ensure data can be recovered
efficiently when needed. Here are the three crucial steps for backup storage:

Secure Offsite Storage:

▪  Store all backups in a secure, offsite facility to protect against physical damage and theft.

Encryption:

▪  Encrypt all backup data to prevent unauthorized access and ensure data privacy.

Retention Period:

▪  Define and adhere to a retention period for keeping backups, balancing storage costs with

recovery needs.

RECOVERY PROCESS

Efficient data recovery is crucial in minimizing the impact of data
loss and ensuring business continuity. This process involves several
key steps that must be executed promptly and accurately to
restore data to its most recent state. The following guidelines
outline the necessary actions for initiating recovery, restoring data,
and verifying its integrity. Adherence to these procedures ensures
that critical information is available and reliable when needed,
maintaining the integrity of the organization's operations.

INITIATE THE RECOVERY PROCESS

Efficient data recovery is crucial in minimizing the impact of data
loss and ensuring business continuity. This process involves several
key steps that must be executed promptly and accurately to
restore data to its most recent state. The following guidelines
outline the necessary actions for initiating recovery, restoring data,
and verifying its integrity. Adherence to these procedures ensures
that critical information is available and reliable when needed,
maintaining the integrity of the organization's operations.

RESTORE DATA

Restore data from the most recent full backup, followed by incremental backups as needed. This
ensures that all data is recovered to its latest state before the loss event. Start with the full backup,
which contains a complete copy of the data at a specific point in time. Next, apply the incremental
backups sequentially to capture all subsequent changes. This layered approach ensures a
comprehensive restoration, minimizing any potential data gaps.

VERIFY DATA INTEGRITY

Verify the integrity and completeness of the recovered data. After the restoration process, conduct
thorough checks to ensure that all data has been accurately recovered. This includes validating file
contents, data structures, and ensuring there are no discrepancies. Automated tools can assist in
verifying data integrity, but manual checks are also important for critical files. Ensuring data
integrity prevents issues in future operations. Regular audits and verification help in identifying any
overlooked errors and confirm that the recovery process meets the organizational standards.

Backup Monitoring and Reporting

Effective backup monitoring and reporting are essential for ensuring the reliability and integrity of
backup processes. Regular monitoring helps identify and address any issues promptly, while
comprehensive reporting provides insights into the performance and success of backup operations.

It is crucial to regularly review backup reports to ensure all data is correctly backed up and
can be restored when needed.

  Daily Monitoring

Daily monitoring involves checking the backup logs and status reports to ensure
that all scheduled backups have been completed successfully. This step helps
identify any failures or issues that need immediate attention. By addressing
problems daily, the risk of data loss is minimized, and the backup process
remains reliable. It also helps in identifying patterns that might indicate deeper
underlying issues.

  Monthly Reports

Monthly reports provide a comprehensive overview of the backup performance
over a longer period. These reports should include details on backup success
rates, any failures, and the resolution of those issues. Reviewing these reports
allows for the identification of trends and potential improvements in the backup
process. It ensures that the backup strategy remains effective and aligned with
the organization's needs.

Issue Resolution

Promptly addressing any issues identified during monitoring is critical. This
involves investigating the cause of any backup failures, implementing corrective
actions, and verifying the success of these actions. Effective issue resolution
ensures that backup processes remain uninterrupted and reliable. Continuous
improvement through issue resolution helps in maintaining the integrity of the
backup system.

  Performance Analysis

Analyzing the performance of the backup system involves evaluating the speed,
efficiency, and reliability of backup processes. This analysis helps in identifying
areas where the backup process can be optimized for better performance. By
continuously analyzing and improving backup performance, organizations can
ensure that their data is always protected and recoverable in a timely manner.
Performance analysis is a key aspect of maintaining a robust data management
strategy.
